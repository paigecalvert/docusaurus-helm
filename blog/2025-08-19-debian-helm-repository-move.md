If you are installing helm with Apt, be aware that the Debian/Ubuntu Helm Apt repository is moving.
Previously the repository was hosted at [Balto](https://helm.baltorepo.com/) and
now it will be hosted at [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/).

Update your APT key and references to the repository using the [new installation instructions](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/#from-apt-debianubuntu).
