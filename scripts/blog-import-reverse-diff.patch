Helm will enter the CNCF as an incubating project as we continue to work on the next-generation Helm 3 cloud-native package manager.  <!--more-->
 
 We are grateful to the Helm community, which has diligently contributed to the core Helm project, to the official charts repository, Monocular, to Chart Museum, and to other Helm-related projects. As a CNCF project, we look forward to expanding the Helm ecosystem. Over the coming months, we will be re-organizing as we ease our way out of the Kubernetes org and into CNCF.

-Earlier this summer, we announced that [Helm joined the CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/06/01/cncf-to-host-helm/) as an official incubating project. Part of that transition involves moving the Helm project out of the Kubernetes GitHub org and into its org. We’re excited to announce that we’ve completed that process. As of last week, we have moved the Helm code repository to [https://github.com/helm/helm](https://github.com/helm/helm).  <!-- truncate -->

 Fun fact: This is the same GitHub repository where the Helm project first started. When we started Helm in 2015, we created the Helm organization in GitHub. But thanks to the enthusiastic support of the Kubernetes community, we migrated the entire codebase into the Kubernetes org in 2016. As a separate CNCF project with its own vibrant and growing ecosystem, it makes sense to once again have Helm back home in its own GitHub org.

-When Helm was part of the Kubernetes project it, like the rest of Kubernetes, used the [CNCF Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://github.com/cncf/cla). This served Helm well for years. But, most of the CNCF projects use a [Developers Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) instead of a CLA. The exceptions are Kubernetes and gRPC. Upon Helm becoming a CNCF project itself we were asked if we wanted to move Helm to a DCO.

 ## What Does This Solve? Why Switch?
 
 Making a change like this should have a good reason and we have one. It is often easier to get started contributing under a DCO than a CLA.

-Being a top level incubating CNCF project requires having a governance structure to ensure that there is a publicly documented process for making decisions regarding the project and the community. While Helm was under Kubernetes, we relied on Kubernetes governance. As part of the transition to CNCF, the Helm project is required to have its own governance structure. To handle this we set up a [provisional governance](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/aa0586011786dfbc3993e7edd959a841241c96e3/governance/provisional-governance.md) with a goal of creating a long term one.

You can read all the details in the [governance doc (here)](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/main/governance/governance.md).

 These testing tools are useful for more than the community charts. They could be used in development workflows, in other testing systems, and for private charts. To make the testing more accessible we (mostly [Reinhard Nägele](https://github.com/unguiculus/)) refactored the tools into a container image that can be run outside of the community charts testing infrastructure.

 Security researcher Bernard Wagner of [Entersekt](https://www.entersekt.com/) discovered a vulnerability in ChartMuseum, impacting **all versions of ChartMuseum between ChartMuseum >=0.1.0 and < 0.8.1**. A specially crafted chart could be uploaded that caused the uploaded archive to be saved outside of the intended location.
 
 When ChartMuseum is configured for multitenancy the specially crafted chart could be uploaded to one tenant but saved in the location of another tenant. This includes overwriting a chart at a version in the other tenant.

 Additionally, if ChartMuseum is configured to use a file system the uploaded Chart archive may be uploaded to locations outside of the storage directory. It could be uploaded to any place the ChartMuseum application binary has write permission to.

 On October 15th, 2015, the project now known as Helm was born. Only one year later, the Helm community joined the Kubernetes organization as Helm 2 was fast approaching. In June 2018, the Helm community [joined the CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/06/01/cncf-to-host-helm/) as an incubating project. Fast forward to today, and Helm 3 is nearing its first alpha release.

+During the Helm 2 development cycle, we introduced Tiller as part of our integration with Google's Deployment Manager. Tiller played an important role for teams working on a shared cluster - it made it possible for multiple different operators to interact with the same set of releases.
 
 With role-based access controls (RBAC) enabled by default in Kubernetes 1.6, locking down Tiller for use in a production scenario became more difficult to manage. Due to the vast number of possible security policies, our stance was to provide a permissive default configuration. This allowed first-time users to start experimenting with Helm and Kubernetes without having to dive headfirst into the security controls. Unfortunately, this permissive configuration could grant a user a broad range of permissions they weren't intended to have. DevOps and SREs had to learn additional operational steps when installing Tiller into a multi-tenant cluster.

 - The release version secret: represents an application's desired state at a particular instance of time (the release of a new version, for example)

 This is part 5 of 7 of our *Helm 3 Preview: Charting Our Future* blog series about chart dependencies and some subtle differences between Helm 2 and Helm 3. (Check out our previous blog post on release management [here](https://helm.sh/blog/helm-3-preview-pt4/).)

+Charts that were packaged (with `helm package`) for use with Helm 2 can be installed with Helm 3, but the chart development workflow received an overhaul, so some changes are necessary to continue developing charts with Helm 3. One of the components that changed was the chart dependency management system.
 
 The Chart dependency management system moved from requirements.yaml and requirements.lock to Chart.yaml and Chart.lock, meaning that charts that relied on the `helm dependency` command will need some tweaking to work in Helm 3.

-Helm 3 supports a class of chart called a "library chart". This is a chart that is shared by other charts, but does not create any release artifacts of its own. A library chart's templates can only declare `define` elements. Globally scoped non-define content is simply ignored. This allows users to re-use and share snippets of code that can be re-used across many charts, avoiding redundancy and keeping charts [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).<!-- truncate -->

+Google has long been gracious in providing funding for this location. Since Helm started using it, Helm (as part of Kubernetes) moved into the CNCF, and then moved out from under the Kubernetes umbrella, becoming a sister project to Kubernetes within the CNCF.
 
 The CNCF is in the process of taking over the infrastructure for Kubernetes. It was time for Helm to move from a location funded by Google to one funded by the CNCF. Google Cloud buckets cannot be transferred between projects, which meant we could not transfer the bucket over to a CNCF account. We needed to move to a new location as part of the move.

 Helm v3 development has hit a new milestone with the release of the [first beta](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta.1). This is an especially important milestone because it is the end of the effort to refactor Helm v3. The last of the _intended_ breaking changes has landed. From this point on, Helm v3 is focused on bug fixes, stability, and preparing it for a stable release.

 Part of the process for Helm to become a graduated CNCF project is to complete an independent and third party security audit with the results being published. As part of the audit of Helm 3 a security issue was found that also impacts Helm v2. [Cure53](https://cure53.de/) performed the audit and found the issue. More about the audit will be covered in a future post.
 
-The vulnerability found impacts **all versions of Helm between Helm >=2.0.0 and < 2.15.2**. Helm commands that deal with loading a chart as a directory or packaging a chart provide an opportunity for a maliciously designed chart to include content not intended in the chart or to execute a denial of service (DOS) on the computer performing the packaging via the use of symlinks.<!-- truncate -->

Her work ranges from big things, like planning and executing two Helm Summits, down to smaller (but still essential) things like managing the [Helm twitter account](https://twitter.com/HelmPack).
 
 Until this point, Karen's role has been pseudo-official. There has been no Helm related title or sub-project of Helm for this work. We are happy to announce that we have now rectified the situation by formalizing community management as a sub-project of Helm with Karen as the person running the show.

+Helm 3 is the latest major release of the CLI tool. Helm 3 builds upon the success of Helm 2, continuing to meet the needs of the evolving ecosystem.
 
 The internal implementation of Helm 3 has changed considerably from Helm 2. The most apparent change is the removal of Tiller, but it's worth checking out the other changes by diving into the new release. A rich set of new features have been added as a result of the community's input and requirements. Some features have been deprecated or refactored in ways that make them incompatible with Helm 2. Some new experimental features have also been introduced, including OCI support.

 When Helm v3 was released in November 2019, our original commitment was that we would offer six months of Helm v2 bug fixes, which would end May 13, 2020, followed by six more months of security fixes for Helm v2. Given the expectation that current priorities require a singular focus on fighting the pandemic, we now plan to release Helm v2 bug fixes for an extra three months, until August 13th, 2020, giving Helm users more time for serving their communities' most immediate needs.

Furthermore, GitHub Actions will power the pipeline for publishing charts. And thanks to GitHub’s blazingly fast network, chart downloads are faster than ever!

Over the last couple of years the number of charts under maintainance increased from ~100 to 300+ causing a commensurate increase in pull requests and updates to the repo.

 With the release of Helm 3.8.0, Helm is able to store and work with charts in container registries, as an alternative to [Helm repositories](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_repository/). This feature, which used to be an experimental feature, is now generally available.

 Over the past several years container registry developers have been working on ways to store other artifacts in container registries. To facilitate this in a cross platform manner, the Open Containers Initiative (OCI) - the organization that defines the specifications for containers - released their [distribution specification](https://specs.opencontainers.org/distribution-spec/?v=v1.0.0) which allowed other "artifacts" to be stored in registries.

This was an effort focused on improving the security posture of Helm and ensuring a continued good experience for Helm users. The fuzzing integration involved enrolling Helm in the [OSS-Fuzz project](https://github.com/cncf/cncf-fuzzing) and writing a set of fuzzers that further enriches the test coverage of Helm. In total, 38 fuzzers were written, and nine bugs were found (with eight fixed so far), demonstrating the work’s value for Helm both short term and long term. All fuzzers were implemented by way of [Go-fuzz](https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz) and are run daily by OSS-Fuzz against the latest Helm commit to make sure Helm is continuously fuzz tested.

 [Helm](https://helm.sh) is described as the Kubernetes package manager. It helps simplify finding, sharing, and using software built for Kubernetes. Helm began as what is now known as [Helm Classic](https://github.com/helm/helm-classic), a Deis project begun in 2015 and introduced at the inaugural KubeCon. In January of 2016, the project merged with a GCS tool called Kubernetes Deployment Manager, and the project was moved under Kubernetes. Helm was promoted from a Kubernetes subproject to a full-fledged CNCF project in June 2018. Helm [graduated as a CNCF project in April 2020](https://www.cncf.io/announcement/2020/04/30/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-helm-graduation/). [The CNCF annual survey of 2022](https://www.cncf.io/reports/cncf-annual-survey-2021) found that around 90% of companies are either using or evaluating Kubernetes, and Helm’s performance and security are important, for the continued business operations of these users.

A number of concepts, working in unison, make it possible to store content aside from traditional container images within OCI registries. This article will explore one of these important concepts, Media Types, their purpose, and how Helm’s own set of Media Types make it possible to extend the storage of charts beyond standard chart repositories to OCI registries.

-We have been saying it for a while now – Helm is "stable software". That should not come as a surprise to anyone familiar with Kubernetes and the surrounding ecosystem as many within the Kubernetes community consider Helm to be the de-facto package manager. The use of Helm is far reaching: from open source community projects, to startups, to Fortune 500 organizations.

+We have been saying it for a while now – Helm is "stable software". That should not come as a surprise to anyone familiar with Kubernetes and the surrounding ecosystem as many within the Kubernetes community consider Helm to be the de-facto package manager. The use of Helm is far reaching: from open source community projects, to startups, to Fortune 500 organizations. Helm has become an essential component of build and deployment workflows that handle mission critical workloads.
 
 One of the primary tenets that the Helm project takes very seriously is its policy related to [backwards compatibility](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#semantic-versioning). This strict adherence towards limiting impacts that could adversely affect end consumers is one of the primary reasons why Helm has become such a stable project that the community can count on. Unfortunately, Helm’s backwards compatibility policy does impose limitations to the types of changes or features that can be introduced. It is important to note that Helm is not just a CLI tool, but it is also an SDK. The Helm SDK supports an entire ecosystem of solutions that have been developed to manage Helm content. Any breaking change could negatively impact one of those integrations.
